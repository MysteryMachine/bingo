# BINGO

Hi folks who might be looking. This was a quick and dirty project I made over a vacation. I wanted to try and play
with React hooks and Next.js. This was deployed using Zeit now. Code here does not represent production quality code,
I got it working and shipped it. This software was built for a friend to use on their livestreams. If you're
here because you're considering hiring me, I'd love to chat about how I'd improve the project and improve
the code quality. Thanks!
